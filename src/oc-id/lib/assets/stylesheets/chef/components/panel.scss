Panels are useful for calling attention to content, often in the form of a sidebar. 
Use them in conjunction with the grid to have them lay out well and behave responsively.

```html_example
<div class="row">
  <div class="medium-4 columns end">

    <div class="panel">
      Words go nicely in here.
      <a href="#">Links</a> do, too.
    </div>
  
  </div>
</div>
```
